I chose the 1Password password manager because it is used by multiple platforms such as iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, and macOS.
I am an avid user of iOS, Windows, and macOS. I have an iPhone, a pc at home, and a macbook for school. All of these devices have very
secure and important passwords. My phone is my most important device and it has a multitude of very secret and personal passwords that I
need and I cannot afford to have stolen. 1Password uses end-to-end encryption to protect my data across all my devices. A feature I 
thought was intersesting was that 1Password uses a zero-knowledge approach, which means that only you have the keys to your information, 
and 1Password itself can't see or access it. LastPass is also a password manager that I found interesting simply because of the name. 
LastPass includes a password generator that can create secure, random passwords for users. I liked how it included the generator in 
the manager itself.
